# JSON Escaper

A simple HTML page that takes user input and displays it with proper JSON escaped string format.

## Getting Started

To use this HTML page, simply clone or download the repository and open the HTML file in a web browser. Enter a payload into the input field and click the "Submit" button to display the payload with proper JSON escaped string format. This can be useful when working with JSON data that needs to be properly formatted to avoid errors.

Please note that the tool only escapes the JSON characters and it's not designed to validate or sanitize the user inputs, so it's important to validate and sanitize the user input before processing it to avoid malicious payloads.

### Prerequisites

A web browser is required to run the HTML file.

### Installing

Clone or download the repository and open the HTML file in a web browser.

### Customization

You can customize the look and feel of the page by editing the CSS styles in the `<style>` tag in the `<head>` of the HTML file.
